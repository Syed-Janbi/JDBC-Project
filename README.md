## About

This project showcases how to connect a Java application to a database using JDBC. It implements basic operations such as connecting to the database, executing queries, and processing results.

## Features

- 100% Java implementation
- JDBC database connectivity
- Simple CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Console-based interface (update if your UI differs)

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above
- A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- JDBC driver for your chosen database

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Syed-Janbi/JDBC-Project.git
    cd JDBC-Project
    ```
2. **Configure the database connection**
   - Update the database URL, username, and password in the relevant Java file (such as `DBConnection.java`).

3. **Download and add the JDBC driver**
   - Download the JDBC driver JAR for your database and add it to your project's classpath.

4. **Compile and run the project**
    ```bash
    javac -cp .:path/to/jdbc-driver.jar src/*.java
    java -cp .:path/to/jdbc-driver.jar src.MainClassName
    ```

## Usage

- Run the application from your terminal or IDE.
- Follow on-screen instructions to perform database operations.
